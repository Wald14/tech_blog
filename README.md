## Usage
Upon arriving to the website, the user is directed to the home page. Here they can view all the blogs that have been posted by others (most recent first). They can click on any of these blogs to view the content and comments. HOWEVER, they can not leave a comment unless they login.

If the user tries to view the dashboard via the navbar, they will be redirected to the login/signup screen. The user can click on the Login button in the navbar to get to this screen as well.

Once at the login/signup screen, the user can either login to their existing account or signup for one. Upon signing up, the user will be automatically logged in. Once logged in, the user is redirected to their dashboard.

At the dashboard, the user can manager all their blogs. They can either click on "+ New Blog" to create a new blog OR they can click on any of their existing blogs to either update or delete said blog. After completing one of these actions, they'll be redirected back to their dashboard.

Once logged in, the "login" button in the navbar changes to a "logout" button. The user can click on this at any time to be logged out and redirected to the Home screen. Additionally, they can stall logged in but after 24hrs their session will expire and they will need to login again.
